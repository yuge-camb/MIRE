    Welcome! This survey aims to gather insights about improving the module review web app 
    (Camments) for Cambridge Engineering students. Your responses will be analysed to develop 
    requirements to enhance both module selection and course improvement processes.
  </p>
  <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 text-left">
    Your goal is to actively provide answers that are both understandable and consistent. Take time to make your responses clear and specific, review them to ensure they can be easily interpreted, and check that they align with your other answers.
    </p>
  <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 text-left">
    As you go through the survey, you may receive clarifications or consistency checks to refine your responses.
